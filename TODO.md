## Plan

âœ… Collect wind speed Data of 5 locations of a year (hourly)
ðŸŸ© Split data in seasons that make sense (a plot to justify?)
ðŸŸ© Fit the Weibull Distrib for each location/seasons (estimate k and lambda) using different methods (MLE/MoM/LS in last year paper)
ðŸŸ© Evaluate models to find the best (AIC/BIC/KS in last year paper)
ðŸŸ© Calculate some statistics concerning wind speed with the best model  (mean/variance/...)
ðŸŸ© Conclude with the best location
